This is a test app for Al Matar Task (al-matar-loyalty-program)


/** How to run the app */
run "npm install"
make sure you have mysql server running on your local machine
run "npm start"
This will start the server and listen on port 3000.

Endpoint routes can be found through startup/routes.js

I was planning on adding a Docker image for the app in order to make everything run easier, but unfortunately I ran out of time a little bit there.
